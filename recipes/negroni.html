  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>One cocktail above all others reveals you as a savvy drinker,<br> 
    according to the legendary Gary Regan, who famously said that <br>
    whether you’re trying to impress a first date or your boss, <br>
    ordering a Negroni will do it. Born of a happy accident during <br>
    the early 20th century, this drink was created by Count Camillo <br>
    Negroni, who swapped the traditional club soda in his Americano <br>
    with gin. The Negroni’s bitter intensity and easy equal-parts <br>
    formula have helped make it a favorite among home and professional <br>
    bartenders alike.
